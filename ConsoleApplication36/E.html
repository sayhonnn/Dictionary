<td>That portion of the Christian church which prevails in the countries once comprised in the Eastern Roman Empire and the countries converted to Christianity by missionaries from them. Its full official title is The Orthodox Catholic Apostolic Eastern Church. It became estranged from the Western or Roman Church over the question of papal supremacy and the doctrine of the filioque and a separation begun in the latter part of the 9th century became final in 1054. The Eastern Church consists of twelve (thirteen if the Bulgarian Church be included) mutually independent churches (including among these the Hellenic Church or Church of Greece and the Russian Church) using the vernacular (or some ancient form of it) in divine service and varying in many points of detail but standing in full communion with each other and united as equals in a great federation. The highest five authorities are the patriarch of Constantinople or ecumenical patriarch (whose position is not one of supremacy but of precedence) the patriarch of Alexandria the patriarch of Jerusalem the patriarch of Antioch and the Holy Synod of Russia. The Eastern Church accepts the first seven ecumenical councils (and is hence styled only schismatic not heretical by the Roman Catholic Church) has as its creed the Niceno-Constantinopolitan (without the later addition of the filioque which with the doctrine it represents the church decisively rejects) baptizes infants with trine immersion makes confirmation follow immediately upon baptism administers the Communion in both kinds (using leavened bread) and to infants as well as adults permits its secular clergy to marry before ordination and to keep their wives afterward but not to marry a second time selects its bishops from the monastic clergy only recognizes the offices of bishop priest and deacon as the three necessary degrees of orders venerates relics and icons and has an elaborate ritual.

 the term is usually used of relatively smooth movements of electric charge through conductors whether constant or variable. Sudden movements of charge are usually referred to by other terms such as spark or lightning or discharge. In metallic conductors the electric current is usually due to movement of electrons through the metal. The current is measured as the rate of movement of charge per unit time and is counted in units of amperes. As a formal definition the direction of movement of electric current is considered as the same as the direction of movement of positive charge or in a direction opposite to the movement of negative charge. Electric current may move constantly in a single direction called direct current (abbreviated DC) or may move alternately in one direction and then the opposite direction called alternating current (abbreviated AC).</td>

<td>[n]</td>
<td>a property of certain of the fundamental particles of which matter is composed called also electric charge and being of two types designated positive and negative
 the property of electric charge on a particle or physical body creates a force field which affects other particles or bodies possessing electric charge
 positive charges create a repulsive force between them and negative charges also create a repulsive force. A positively charged body and a negatively charged body will create an attractive force between them. The unit of electrical charge is the coulomb and the intensity of the force field at any point is measured in volts
  any of several phenomena associated with the accumulation or movement of electrically charged particles within material bodies classified as static electricity and electric current. Static electricity is often observed in everyday life when it causes certain materials to cling together
 when sufficient static charge is accumulated an electric current may pass through the air between two charged bodies and is observed as a visible spark
 when the spark passes from a human body to another object it may be felt as a mild to strong painful sensation. Electricity in the form of electric current is put to many practical uses in electrical and electronic devices. Lightning is also known to be a form of electric current passing between clouds and the ground or between two clouds. Electric currents may produce heat light concussion and often chemical changes when passed between objects or through any imperfectly conducting substance or space. Accumulation of electrical charge or generation of a voltage differnce between two parts of a complex object may be caused by any of a variety of disturbances of molecular equilibrium whether from a chemical physical or mechanical cause. Electric current in metals and most other solid coductors is carried by the movement of electrons from one part of the metal to another. In ionic solutions and in semiconductors other types of movement of charged particles may be responsible for the observed electrical current

The electron carries (or is) a natural unit of negative electricity equal to 3.4 x 10-10 electrostatic units and is classed by physicists as a lepton. Its mass is practically constant at the lesser speeds but increases due to relativistic effects as the velocity approaches that of light. Electrons are all of one kind so far as is known. Thus far no structure has been detected within an electron and it is probably one of the ultimate composite constituents of all matter. An atom or group of atoms from which an electron has been detached has a positive charge and is called a cation. Electrons are projected from the cathode of vacuum tubes (including television picture tubes) as cathode rays and from radioactive substances as the beta rays. Previously also referred to as corpuscle an obsolete term. The motion of electrons through metallic conductors is observed as an electric current. A particle identical to the electron in mass and most other respects but having a positive instead of a negative charge is called a positron or antielectron.</td>
