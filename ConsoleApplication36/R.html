 the Molokane who refuse to recognize civil authority or to take oaths

  One of two theories (also called theory of relativity) proposed by Albert Einstein the special theory of relativity or the general theory of relativity. The special theory of relativity or special relativity is based on the proposition that the speed of light is a constant no matter how observed and is independent of the motion of the observer. From this follows several principles such as the increase of mass with velocity (which has been confirmed: see relativistic mass equation) and the impossibility of acceleration to a speed greater than that of light
 the equivalence of mass and energy expressed by the famous equation E = mc2
 and time dilation which is the apparent slowing of a clock in a system as observed by an observer in a system moving relative to the clock. The general theory of relativity is based on the proposition that there is no physical difference between gravitational force and the force produced by acceleration. From this follow several results of which the bending of light rays in a gravitational field and the equivalence of the inertial and gravitational masses have been verified. The possible existence of black holes (believed by many astronomers to have been adequately proven) is another consequence of the theory.</td>

<td>The calendar of the ancient Romans from which our modern calendars are derived. It is said to have consisted originally of ten months Martius Aprilis Maius Junius Quintilis Sextilis September October November and December having a total of 304 days. Numa added two months Januarius at the beginning of the year and Februarius at the end making in all 355 days. He also ordered an intercalary month Mercedinus to be inserted every second year. Later the order of the months was changed so that January should come before February. Through abuse of power by the pontiffs to whose care it was committed this calendar fell into confusion. It was replaced by the Julian calendar. In designating the days of the month the Romans reckoned backward from three fixed points the calends the nones and the ides. The calends were always the first day of the month. The ides fell on the 15th in March May July (Quintilis) and October and on the 13th in other months. The nones came on the eighth day (the ninth counting the ides) before the ides. Thus Jan. 13 was called the ides of January Jan. 12 the day before the ides and Jan. 11 the third day before the ides (since the ides count as one) while Jan. 14 was the 19th day before the calends of February.</td>

It still forms a portion by far the largest of the Orthodox (Eastern) Church and is governed by the Patriarch and the Holy Synod. In 1988 the church with official approval celebrated the 1000 year anniversary of the baptism of Russia. After breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 the Russian Church began to regain some its old influence in Russian life and the government turned over some of the confiscated churches back to church control. The Russian Church was recognized anew as the official church of Russia with special priveleges by an act of the Russian Duma in 1997. The Metropolitan of Moscow as Patriarch of the church is regarded as the first among equals in order of deference among bishops of the church.</td>
