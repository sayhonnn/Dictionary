<td>C is the third letter of the English alphabet. It is from the Latin letter C which in old Latin represented the sounds of k and g (in go)
 its original value being the latter. In Anglo-Saxon words or Old English before the Norman Conquest it always has the sound of k. The Latin C was the same letter as the Greek Γ γ and came from the Greek alphabet. The Greeks got it from the Phoenicians. The English name of C is from the Latin name ce and was derived probably through the French. Etymologically C is related to g h k q s (and other sibilant sounds). Examples of these relations are in L. acutus E. acute ague
 E. acrid eager vinegar

It may be fatal but can be reversed or alleviated by returning the affected person to a high air pressure and then gradually decreasing the pressure to allow the gases to be released from the body fluids. It is a danger well known to divers. It is also called the bends and decompression sickness.

Other cephalosporins have been found to be produced by species of soil bacteria (actinomycetes). Many semisynthetic analogs have been tested for antibacterial effect and several of them have found use as important clinically useful antibacterial agents some of which may be taken orally for treatment of bacterial infections. The cephalosporins are the second class of beta-lactam antibiotic to be discovered the first being the penicillins and more recent classes being the thienamycins and sulfazecins. The cephamycins are a variant of cephalosporins with a methoxyl group on the beta-lactam ring rendering them more resistant to penicillinases. Among the cephalosporins which have been found clinically useful are cephalexin cephaloridine and cephalothin.</td>

Its function is to prevent fire or damage to the circuit or the devices on the circuit which could be caused by excess current such as that caused by a short-circuit. It differs from a fuse in not having a conducting element which melts (see 2nd fuse n.). Circuit breakers are designed to be easily reset i. e. to reclose the circuit after it has been opened by the circuit breaker
 this is usually accomplished by simply moving a switch back and forth. They are commonly used in buildings to protect individual electrical lines and are often contained in groups within a box called a circuit breaker panel which divides the current from a main electrical line into multiple circuits each protected by a separate circuit breaker. Less commonly they may be found on individual devices.</td>

<td>clock</td>
<td>[n]</td>
<td>A machine for measuring time indicating the hour and other divisions
 in ordinary mechanical clocks for domestic or office use the time is indicated on a typically circular face or dial plate containing two hands pointing to numbers engraved on the periphery of the face thus showing the hours and minutes. The works of a mechanical clock are moved by a weight or a spring and it is often so constructed as to tell the hour by the stroke of a hammer on a bell. In electrical or electronic clocks the time may be indicated as on a mechanical clock by hands but may also be indicated by direct digital readout with the hours and minutes in normal Arabic numerals. The readout using hands is often called analog to distinguish it from the digital readout. Some clocks also indicate the seconds. Clocks are not adapted like the watch to be carried on the person. Specialized clocks such as atomic clocks may be constructed on different principles and may have a very high precision for use in scientific observations

<td>The native church of Egypt or church of Alexandria which in general organization and doctrines resembles the Roman Catholic Church except that it holds to the Monophysitic doctrine which was condemned (a. d. 451) by the council of Chalcedon and allows its priests to marry. The “pope and patriarch” has jurisdiction over the Abyssinian Church. Since the 7th century the Coptic Church has been so isolated from modifying influences that in many respects it is the most ancient monument of primitive Christian rites and ceremonies. But centuries of subjection to Moslem rule have weakened and degraded it.</td>
