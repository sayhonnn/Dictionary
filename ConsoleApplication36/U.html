U and V are now however differentiated U being used only as a vowel or semivowel and V only as a consonant. The true primary vowel sound of U in Anglo-Saxon was the sound which it still retains in most of the languages of Europe that of long oo as in tool and short oo as in wood answering to the French ou in tour.
