<td>V the twenty-second letter of the English alphabet is a vocal consonant. V and U are only varieties of the same character U being the cursive form while V is better adapted for engraving as in stone. The two letters were formerly used indiscriminately and till a comparatively recent date words containing them were often classed together in dictionaries and other books of reference (see U). The letter V is from the Latin alphabet where it was used both as a consonant (about like English w) and as a vowel. The Latin derives it from a form (V) of the Greek vowel Υ (see Y) this Greek letter being either from the same Semitic letter as the digamma F (see F) or else added by the Greeks to the alphabet which they took from the Semitic. Etymologically v is most nearly related to u w f b p

  any of numerous submicroscopic complex organic objects which have genetic material and may be considered as living organisms but have no proper cell membrane and thus cannot by themselves perform metabolic processes requiring entry into a host cell in order to multiply. The simplest viruses have no lipid envelope and may be considered as complex aggregates of molecules sometimes only a nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) and a coat protein. They are sometimes viewed as being on the borderline between living and nonliving objects. They are smaller than living cells in size usually between 20 and 300 nm
 thus they pass through standard filters and were previously referred to as filterable virus. The manifestations of disease caused by multiplication of viruses in cells may be due to destruction of the cells caused by subversion of the cellular metabolic processes by the virus or by synthesis of a virus-specific toxin. Viruses may infect animals plants or microorganisms
 those infecting bacteria are also called bacteriophages. Certain bacteriophages may be non-destructive and benign in the host
