  Roger Bacon. A celebrated English philosopher of the thirteenth century. Born at or near Ilchester Somersetshire about 1214: died probably at Oxford in 1294. He is credited with a recognition of the importance of experiment in answering questions about the natural world recognized the potential importance of gunpowder and explosives generally and wrote comments about several of the physical sciences that anticipated facts proven by experiment only much later
  Francis Bacon. A celebrated English philosopher jurist and statesman son of Sir Nicholas Bacon. Born at York House London Jan. 22 1561: died at Highgate April 9 1626 created Baron Verulam July 12 1618 and Viscount St. Albans Jan. 27 1621: commonly but incorrectly called Lord Bacon. He studied at Trinity College Cambridge April 1573 to March 1575 and at Gray's Inn 1575
 became attached to the embassy of Sir Amias Paulet in France in 1576
 was admitted to the bar in 1582
 entered Parliament in 1584
 was knighted in 1603
 became solicitor-general in 1607 and attorney-general in 1613
 was made a privy councilor in 1616 lord keeper in 1617 and lord chancellor in 1618
 and was tried in 1621 for bribery condemned fined and removed from office. A notable incident of his career was his connection with the Earl of Essex which began in July 1591 remained an intimate friendship until the fall of Essex (1600-01) and ended in Bacon's active efforts to secure the conviction of the earl for treason. (See Essex.) His great fame rests upon his services as a reformer of the methods of scientific investigation
 and though his relation to the progress of knowledge has been exaggerated and misunderstood his reputation as one of the chief founders of modern inductive science is well grounded. His chief works are the "Advancement of Learning" published in English as "The Two Books of Francis Bacon of the Proficience and Advancement of Learning Divine and Human" in 1605
 the "Novum organum sive indicia vera de interpretatione naturae" published in Latin 1620 as a "second part" of the (incomplete) "Instauratio magna"
 the "De dignitate et augmentis scientiarum" published in Latin in 1623

They are the smallest of microscopic organisms which have their own metabolic processes carried on within cell membranes viruses being smaller but not capable of living freely. The bacteria are very widely diffused in nature and multiply with marvelous rapidity both by fission and by spores. Bacteria may require oxygen for their energy-producing metabolism and these are called aerobes
 or may multiply in the absence of oxygen these forms being anaerobes. Certain species are active agents in fermentation while others appear to be the cause of certain infectious diseases.

In normal DNA the base adenine on one strand of DNA pairs with thymine on the opposite strand and cytosine on one strand pairs with guanine on the opposite strand. The term base pair usually includes the sugar (ribose or deoxyribose) and the phosphate bound to each base to form a nucleotide unit. One base pair is sometimes used as a unit of length or size for DNA and in this usage is abbreviated bp

<td>buddha</td>
<td>[n]</td>
<td>The title of an incarnation of self-abnegation virtue and wisdom
  The title of Siddhartha or Gautama a deified religious teacher of the Buddhists and the founder of Buddhism
 called also Gautama Siddartha or Sakya Sinha (or Muni). From three newly discovered inscriptions of the emperor Asoka it follows that the 37th year of his reign was reckoned as the 257th from the death of Buddha. Hence it is inferred that Buddha died between 482 and 472 B. C. It being agreed that he lived to be eighty he was born between 562 and 552 B. C. The Buddhist narratives of his life are overgrown with legend and myth. Senart seeks to trace in them the history of the sun-hero. Oldenberg finds in the most ancient traditions -- those of Ceylon -- at least definite historical outlines. Siddhartha as Buddha was called before entering upon his great mission was born in the country and tribe of the Sakhyas at the foot of the Nepalese Himalayas. His father Suddhodana was rather a great and wealthy landowner than a king. He passed his youth in opulence at Kapila-vastu the Sakhya capital. He was married and had a son Rahula who became a member of his order. At the age of twenty-nine he left parents wife and only son for the spiritual struggle of a recluse. After seven years he believed himself possessed of perfect truth and assumed the title of Buddha 'the enlightened.' He is represented as having received a sudden illumination as he sat under the Bo-tree or ' tree of knowledge' at Bodhgaya or Buddha-Gaya. For twenty-eight or as later narratives give it forty-nine days he was variously tempted by Mara. One of his doubts was whether to keep for himself the knowledge won or to share it. Love triumphed and he began to preach at first at Benares. For forty-four years he preached in the region of Benares and Behar. Primitive Buddhism is only to be gathered by inference from the literature of a later time. Buddha did not array himself against the old religion. The doctrines were rather the outgrowth of those of certain Brahmanical schools. His especial concern was salvation from sorrow and so from existence. There are "four noble truths": (1) existence is suffering
 (2) the cause of pain is desire (3) cessation of pain is possible through the suppression of desire
 (4) the way to this is the knowledge and observance of the "good law " of Buddha. The end is Nirvana the cessation of existence. Buddhism was preached in the vulgar tongue and had a popular literature and an elaborately organized monastic and missionary system. It made its way into Afghanistan Bactriana. Tibet and China. It passed away in India not from Brahman persecution but rather from internal causes such as its too abstract nature too morbid view of life relaxed discipline and overgrowth of monasticism and also because Shivaism and Vishnuism employed many of its own weapons more effectively. The system has been variously modified in dogma and rites in the many countries to which it has spread. It is supposed to number about 850000000 of adherents who are principally in Ceylon Tibet China and Japan.</td>

 yet it was characterized by elevated humanity and morality. It presents release from existence (a beatific enfranchisement Nirvana) as the greatest good. Buddhists believe in transmigration of souls through all phases and forms of life. Their number was estimated in 1881 at 470000000.</td>
