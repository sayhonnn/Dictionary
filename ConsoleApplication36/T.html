 T-cells mature in the thymus and B-cells in the bone marrow (in birds in the Bursa of Fabricius). They also have different antigen receptors from those of B-cells. T-cells differentiate into cells that can directly kill infecting cells (cell-mediated immunity cytotoxity) or activate other cells of the immune system (helper T cells) whereas B-cells differentiate on activation into antibody-secreting plasma cells. Helper T cells interact with B-cells by secreting lymphokines that stimulate the B cell which have detected a foreign antigen to enter the cell cycle and develop by repeated mitosis into a clone of cells with identical receptors and then to secrete antibodies to that specific antigen.</td>

<td>Time
 period
 season
  The alternate rising and falling of the waters of the ocean and of bays rivers etc. connected therewith. The tide ebbs and flows twice in each lunar day or the space of a little more than twenty-four hours. It is occasioned by the attraction of the sun and moon (the influence of the latter being three times that of the former) acting unequally on the waters in different parts of the earth thus disturbing their equilibrium. A high tide upon one side of the earth is accompanied by a high tide upon the opposite side. Hence when the sun and moon are in conjunction or opposition as at new moon and full moon their action is such as to produce a greater than the usual tide called the spring tide as represented in the cut. When the moon is in the first or third quarter the sun's attraction in part counteracts the effect of the moon's attraction thus producing under the moon a smaller tide than usual called the neap tide

It is ductile at 2120 when it can be drawn out into wire which is not very tenacious
 it melts at 4420 and at a higher temperature burns with a brilliant white light. Air and moisture act on tin very slightly. The peculiar properties of tin especially its malleability its brilliancy and the slowness with which it rusts make it very serviceable. With other metals it forms valuable alloys as bronze gun metal bell metal pewter and solder. It is not easily oxidized in the air and is used chiefly to coat iron to protect it from rusting in the form of tin foil with mercury to form the reflective surface of mirrors and in solder bronze speculum metal and other alloys.
