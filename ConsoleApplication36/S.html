 one a mere hissing as in sack this
 the other a vocal hissing (the same as that of z) as in is wise. Besides these it sometimes has the sounds of sh and zh as in sure measure.

  To be obliged
 must
  As an auxiliary shall indicates a duty or necessity whose obligation is derived from the person speaking
 as you shall go
 he shall go
 that is I order or promise your going. It thus ordinarily expresses in the second and third persons a command a threat or a promise. If the auxillary be emphasized the command is made more imperative the promise or that more positive and sure. It is also employed in the language of prophecy
 as “the day shall come when . . .  ” since a promise or threat and an authoritative prophecy nearly coincide in significance. In shall with the first person the necessity of the action is sometimes implied as residing elsewhere than in the speaker
 as I shall suffer
 we shall see
 and there is always a less distinct and positive assertion of his volition than is indicated by will. “I shall go” implies nearly a simple futurity
 more exactly a foretelling or an expectation of my going in which naturally enough a certain degree of plan or intention may be included
 emphasize the shall and the event is described as certain to occur and the expression approximates in meaning to our emphatic “I will go.” In a question the relation of speaker and source of obligation is of course transferred to the person addressed
 as “Shall you go?” (answer “I shall go”)
 “Shall he go?” i. e. “Do you require or promise his going?” (answer “He shall go”.) The same relation is transferred to either second or third person in such phrases as “You say or think you shall go
” “He says or thinks he shall go.” After a conditional conjunction (as if whether) shall is used in all persons to express futurity simply
 as if I you or he shall say they are right. Should is everywhere used in the same connection and the same senses as shall as its imperfect. It also expresses duty or moral obligation
 as he should do it whether he will or not. In the early English and hence in our English Bible shall is the auxiliary mainly used in all the persons to express simple futurity. (Cf. Will v. t.) Shall may be used elliptically
 thus with an adverb or other word expressive of motion go may be omitted.</td>

 it is sometimes classified as a protist. It is called also acellular slime mold
  Any of several remarkable amoebalike organisms of the phylum Acrasiomycota mostly terrestrial having a fruiting phase resembling that of the acellular slime molds but being cellular and nucleate throughout their life cycle
 called also cellular slime mold. The most studied species is Dictyostelium discoideum. In their feeding phase they live like amoebae as individual cells engulfing bacteria as a prime food source. When the food source diminishes they begin to aggregate swarming together to form clumps which may move toward heat and light so as to reach the surface of the ground
 they then differentiate into a form with spores contained within a sporangium resting on a stalk. When the spores are carried to another location with adequate food supplies the spores may germinate to resume the life cycle. The phase of aggregation appears to be initiated by release of cyclic AMP serving as a signal between the individual cells. The formation of the fruiting body has some similarities to differentiation in multicellular organisms but the mechanisms are still under study. Some biologists object to the classification of Dictyostelium as a slime mold as it is neither a mold nor slimy.</td>

<td>A mathematical theory for describing the properties of fundamental particles which represents the particles as one-dimensional string-like objects which exist in the normal four dimensions of space-time plus additional dimensions the total dimensions being ten eleven or twenty-six depending on the version of the theory. The properties of fundamental particles in string theory and their manner of interaction with each other depend upon the modes of vibration of the strings{17}. The attractiveness of this theory rests in part on its ability to provide a unified treatment of gravity as well as the three other basic forces of nature in a manner consistent with quantum mechanics. The great difficulty of doing the calculations required by the theory however has thus far (1999) made it impossible to calculate the observable properties such as the mass of known particles such as the electron proton mesons quarks and neutron
 thus there is as yet no experimental verification for the theory. The most popular version of the theory depends on a mathematical property called supersymmetry and the theory derived form this principle is properly called superstring theory a term which is often used interchangeably with string theory.

It is usually thought to be a charm talisman or religious token esp. a sign of good luck or benediction. Max MuLler distinguished from the swastika with arms prolonged to the right the suavastika with arms prolonged to the left but this distinction is not commonly recognized. Other names for the swastika are fylfot and gammadion.</td>
