The dance is the chief rite of the Ghost-dance or Messiah religion which originated about 1890 in the doctrines of the Piute Wovoka the Indian Messiah who taught that the time was drawing near when the whole Indian race the dead with the living should be reunited to live a life of millennial happiness upon a regenerated earth. The religion inculcates peace righteousness and work and holds that in good time without warlike intervention the oppressive white rule will be removed by the higher powers. The religion spread through a majority of the western tribes of the United States only in the case of the Sioux owing to local causes leading to an outbreak.</td>
