<td>Philippus Aureolus Paracelsus (originally Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim also called Theophrastus Paracelsus and Theophrastus von Hohenheim). Born at Maria-Einsiedeln in the Canton of Schwyz Switzerland Dec. 17 (or 10 Nov.) 1493: died at Salzburg Sept. 23 (or 24) 1541. A celebrated German-Swiss physician reformer of therapeutics iatrochemist and alchemist. He attended school in a small lead-mining district where his father William Bombast von Hohenheim was a physician and teacher of alchemy. The family originally came from Wurtemberg where the noble family of Bombastus was in possession of the ancestral castle of Hohenheim near Stuttgart until 1409. He entered the University of Basel at the age of sixteen where he adopted the name Paracelsus after Celsius a noted Roman physician. But he left without a degree first going to Wurtzburg to study under Joannes Trithemius Abbot of Sponheim (1462-1516) a famous astrologer and alchemist who initiated him into the mysteries of alchemy. He then spent many years in travel and intercourse with distinguished scholars studied and practiced medicine and surgery and at one point attended the Diet of Worms. He was appointed to the office of city physician of Basel which also made him a lecturer on medicine at Basel about 1526 where through the publisher Johan Frobenius he made friends with the scholar Erasmus
 and there he fulminated against the medical pseudo-science of his day and against the blind adherence to ancient medical authorities such as Hippocrates Galen and Avicenna which was still the prevalent philosophy of medicine in the sixteenth century. But soon in 1528 he was driven from the city by the medical corporations whose methods he had severely criticized. He found refuge with friends and traveled and practiced medicine but could not find a publisher willing to print his books. He preached frequently the need for experimentation in medicine. He is important in the history of medicine chiefly on account of the impetus which he gave to the development of pharmaceutical chemistry. He was also the author of a visionary and theosophic system of philosophy. The first collective edition of his works appeared at Basel in 1589-91. Among the many legends concerning him is that concerning his long sword which he obtained while serving as barber-surgeon during the Neapolitan wars. It was rumored that in the hilt of the sword he kept a familiar or small demon
 some thought he carried the elixer of life in the sword. He is buried in the cemetary of the Hospital of St. Sebastian in Salzburg. For more detailed information about Paracelsus there is a special project the Zurich Paracelsus Project available on the Web.</td>

The letter V is from the Latin alphabet where it was used both as a consonant (about like English w) and as a vowel. The Latin derives it from a form (V) of the Greek vowel Υ (see Y) this Greek letter being either from the same Semitic letter as the digamma F (see F) or else added by the Greeks to the alphabet which they took from the Semitic.

They are notable as powerful antibacterial agents of relatively low toxicity which have found extensive use in medicine for treating bacterial infections. They are categorized as one of the classes of beta-lactam antibiotic. They are produced naturally by some fungi and bacteria and industrial production processes almost invariably start from some form of the penicillin nucleus produced by fermentation of microorganisms. The fermentation products are then chemically modified to produce derivatives of enhanced potency safety or antibacterial spectrum. The first penicillin to see extensive use clinically (during World War II) was penicillin G also called benzypenicillin and commonly simply “penicillin”.</td>

Penicillinase production in various bacterial species may be induced i.e. it may occur only when stimulated by the presence of penicillin in the culture medium or it may be constitutive i.e. it may occur whenever the cells are producing protein. Molecular weights of the various penicillinases tend to cluster near 50000.</td>

  A particular appearance or state in a regularly recurring cycle of changes with respect to quantity of illumination or form of enlightened disk
 as the phases of the moon or planets. See Illust. under Moon
  Any one point or portion in a recurring series of changes as in the changes of motion of one of the particles constituting a wave or vibration
 one portion of a series of such changes in distinction from a contrasted portion as the portion on one side of a position of equilibrium in contrast with that on the opposite side

  The relation at any instant of a periodically varying electric magnitude as electro-motive force a current etc. to its initial value as expressed in factorial parts of the complete cycle. It is usually expressed in angular measure the cycle beb four right angles or 360°. Such periodic variations are generally well represented by sine curves
 and phase relations are shown by the relative positions of the crests and hollows of such curves. Magnitudes which have the same phase are said to be in phase
  the relation at any instant of any cyclically varying physical quantity such as voltage in an A.C. circuit an electromagnetic wave a sound wave or a rotating object to its initial value as expressed as a fractional part of the complete cycle.

Thus if the components be salt and water and the phases salt ice saturated solution and vapor the system is invariant that is there is only one set of conditions under which these four phases can exist in equilibrium. If only three phases be considered the system is univariant that is the fixing of one condition as temperature determines the others.</td>

It was formerly called assimilation but this is now commonly used as in animal physiology. The details of the process are not yet clearly known. Baeyer's theory is that the carbon dioxide is reduced to carbon monoxide which uniting with the hydrogen of the water in the cell produces formaldehyde the latter forming various sugars through polymerization. Vines suggests that the carbohydrates are secretion products of the chloroplasts derived from decomposition of previously formed proteids. The food substances are usually quickly translocated those that accumulate being changed to starch which appears in the cells almost simultaneously with the sugars. The chloroplasts perform photosynthesis only in light and within a certain range of temperature varying according to climate. This is the only way in which a plant is able to organize carbohydrates. All plants without a chlorophyll apparatus as the fungi must be parasitic or saprophytic.</td>

<td>A geological theory which holds that the crust of the earth (the lithosphere) is divided into a small number of large separate plates which float and move slowly around on the more plastic asthenosphere breaking apart and moving away from each other at points where magma upwells from below and driven by such upwellings and other currents on the athenosphere sliding past each other colliding with each other and in some cases being submerged (subducted) one below the other. This theory is now widely accepted and explains many geological phenomena such as the clustered locations of earthquakes mountain building volcanism and the similarities observed between the geology of continents such as South America and Africa which are now far apart but according to the theory were once joined together. The motions of such tectonic plates are very slow typically only several centimeters per year but over tens and hundreds of millions of years cause very large changes in the relative positions of the continents. The consequence of such movement of plates is called continental drift.</td>

<td>[n]</td>
<td>A radioactive chemical element discovered by M. and MMe. Curie in pitchblende and originally called radium F. It has atomic number 84 and an atomic weight of 210. It is a very rare natural element having an abundance in uranium ores only 0.2% that of radium. It is closely related chemically to bismuth. It emits only alpha rays and has a half-life of 138 days. It is thus more unstable than radium and a milligram of polonium emits as many alpha particles as 5 grams of radium. Twenty-seven isotopes are known with atomic masses from 192 to 218. At present a more practical method of preparation than isolation from ores is the preparation by neutron bombardment of bismuth in a nuclear reactor and it may be obtained commercially by users having an appropriate permit.</td>

<td>In the broadest sense the theory or practice of any of several groups of painters of the early 1900's or of these groups taken collectively whose work and theories have in common a tendency to reaction against the scientific and naturalistic character of impressionism and neo-impressionism. In a strict sense the term post-impressionism is used to denote the effort at self-expression rather than representation shown in the work of Cezanne Matisse etc.
 but it is more broadly used to include cubism the theory or practice of a movement in both painting and sculpture which lays stress upon volume as the important attribute of objects and attempts its expression by the use of geometrical figures or solids only
 and futurism a theory or practice which attempts to place the observer within the picture and to represent simultaneously a number of consecutive movements and impressions. In practice these theories and methods of the post-impressionists change with great rapidity and shade into one another so that a picture may be both cubist and futurist in character. They tend to and sometimes reach a condition in which both representation and traditional decoration are entirely abolished and a work of art becomes a purely subjective expression in an arbitrary and personal language.</td>
